# Socket-Client-server-linux-c
This is a project to make a client server setup, first for loopback mode.
Then there is a connection from my raspberry pi to my laptop
checking for both systems for becoming server and client one by one

In the end, make a system with multi threaded server which processes requests coming from client like raspberry pi and give it back.
